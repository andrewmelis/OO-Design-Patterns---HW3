I used ruby for this assignment. Please ignore the PhMMM.rb file, as it is no longer used.

You can use the included test class for additional grading. Right now,
it runs one test provided with the assignment and a manual run.

Note that the various layers are singletons, so you can use the already created variables for easier testing.
